            open for you to explore any way you choose.

            You should already know what Skyrim is. Go buy it; again. Buy Elder
            Scrolls Online too while you're at it.

            Todd Howard was in the chess club. And now he makes Skyrim for the
            past decade. Wow. Amazing. Such Talent. Everyone should buy Skyrim.

          <h3>Amazing world design</h3>
          <p>
            Skyrim is a vast and expansive open world with many towns, villages,
            dungeons, and more to visit. Tons of npc's in populated areas to
            talk to. And, if you're lucky, you may even come across one in the
            wild. And if you're even luckier (from a certain point of view) they
            won't be dumb enough to attack you after witnessing you single
            handedly kill a dragon and devour it's soul and flesh leaving only
            bones behind by simply staring blankly at it's corpse.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, more than likely they'll attack you anyway and you'll likely be
            low health after your amazing fight with the dragon&trade;. Though
            never fear, simply inhale the 300 wheels of cheese you conveniently
            keep in your back pocket that you &quot;accuired&quot; from the
            nearby village and you'll be ready to face whatever had the audacity
            to walk too close to you.
          </p>

            WOW! Do you see that mountain over there? That's right, you can
            climb it. And so can your horse, better than you can, even.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Skyrim's extreme realism you can climb any mountain, hill,
            house, rock, boat, or anything else your heart desires. Just don't
            slip! Or you may end up plummeting to your Doom&trade;. Amazing!
            Just like real life.<br />You can even go higher than the talles
            mountain if you'd like. Simply visit the nearest giant camp and wave
            hello. You'll be flung to the edge of space posthaste. And don't
            worry, if you survive being launched into space, you won't be able
            to survive the return trip.

          <h3>Great Community</h3>
          <p>
            Despite Todd's attempts at monitizing mods, the modding community
            has made tens of thousands of mods. Ranging from small tweaks,
            graphics improvements, animation changes, content additions like new
            items or abilities, and even complete game overhauls. With so many
            mods to choose from you'll always find new ways to play the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            A team of developers has even created a completely free total
            conversion mod for Skyrim called &quot;Enderal: Forgotten
            Stories&quot;. The team behind this game not only crafted a brand
            new story but also overhauled the skill systems and gameplay
            mechanics present in Skyrim. Additionally they restructured terrain
            and built all new detailed and diverse landscapes to explore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Install enough mods and you'll eventually barely be able to
            recognize the game. You can even install community made bug fix mods
            to repair the broken mess of a game that Todd and his team left at
            your door step.
