            Descend into the depths of an alien underwater world filled with
            wonder and peril. Craft equipment, pilot submarines and out-smart
            wildlife to explore lush coral reefs, volcanoes, cave systems, and
            more - all while trying to survive.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to
            go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow
            coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and
            bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you
            explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The
            water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.
          </p>
          <p>
            After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find
            water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore.
            Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear,
            lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and
            further to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and
            manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base
            to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as
            you explore the vast ocean.

          <p>
            Subnautica is a large open world with many diverse and beautiful
            areas to explore. These areas have many different kinds of fauna and
            flora that make the world feel alive and natural. There are lots of
            things to discover. Equipment to help you survive, technologies to
            help you thrive, revelations of the fishy inhabitants of this
            mysterious planet and of those who visited before your arrival.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the discoveries you make to build tools, bases, and more
            equipment. These constructed items will help you thrive on this
            ocean planet and help you discover new things and explore further
            than you were able to before.
          </p>

            Small fish, big fish, microscopic fish, fish the size of boats and
            even bigger. Friendly fish, mean fish, tasty fish, and cute fish.
            Electric fish, transparent fish, fish with big eyes, fish with no
            eyes, flying fish, walking fish, noot fish, cthulhu fish, and fish
            that want to punch you. Subnautica has so many different types of
            fish. These fish even have revolutionary AI. As you swim closer,
            some of these fish will swim away from you. Wow.<br />And only
            <em>most</em>
            of them want to rip you to shreds. Even the plants are deadly!

            You can interact with the fauna and flora in Subnautica in many
            different ways. You can eat them, turn them into water, collect
            them, keep them in your pocket for later, put them in an aquarium in
            your base, feed them, study them, and collect scientific data about
            them.

            Hey! Take a look at that cute fish.<br />On such a lonely planet,
            light years away from other people, it's nice to have some kind of
            companionship. Ideally one that's not a volley ball. During your
            explorations, if you look hard enough you'll find this cute fish,
            also known as the cuddle fish. This cute fish will bring joy and
            love to your underwater base. You can even invite cute fish to come
            with you on your adventures. If your &quot;heart&quot; is made of a
            solid block of ice that never melts, you may think of putting cute
            fish in your bio reactor to generate a large amount of power. But
            you may want to reconsider doing that as you may find the weight on
            your conscience unbearable; if you even have one.

          <h3>The protagonist</h3>
          <img

            alt="Ryley from subnautica"
          />
          <p>
            You play as
            <b>Non-Essential Systems Maintenance Chief Ryley Robinson</b> who
            survived the crash onto this ocean planet by escaping on a lifepod
            just in time, and really likes hair gel. Don't be fooled though.
            This janitor is extremely talented. Almost nothing is known about
            Ryley. But what we do know, we know from his actions. Ryley is an
            expert welder, capable of repairing even the most damaged equipment
            in dangerous and stressful situations. A master craftsman, capable
            of creating and building complex tools and machinery like
            submersibles and nuclear reactors. A talented researcher, capable of
            deducing what occured on this planet an unknown period of time prior
            to his arrival simply by exploring and observing remnants of past
            visitors and examining their complex technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Will we ever find out more about Ryley and his life before coming to
            this ocean planet? Will we learn how he became a legendary master of
            all trades and sciences? No.
