          <h3>Changing Video Games</h3>
          <p>
            While not the first, the original Doom released in 1993 brought much
            wider popularity to the first person shooter genre of video games
            and is considered the most influential game in this genre. For many
            years, &quot;Doom clone&quot; was used as the name for this genre
            due to it's influence.

          <h3>idspispopd easter egg</h3>
          <img

            alt="elephant smashes pumpkin"
          />
          <p>
            The cheat code &quot;idspispopd&quot; from the original doom,
            particularly &quot;SPISPOPD&quot;, can be traced back to a post by
            Eli S. Bingham in December, 1993.
          </p>

                &quot;Listen up, ID Software!<br />
                Next time you have an impending release of a much anticipated
                game, make sure its name is not so cool-sounding as DOOM and
                much longer to eliminate all of the casual "Where can I get xxx"
                posts. How about "Smashing Pumpkins Into Small Piles Of Putrid
                Debris" for the next game?&quot;

            id Software later gave a nod to this joke as a cheat code in the
            game. The band &quot;The Smashing Pumpkins&quot; also referenced the
            joke by having Doom samples in their song &quot;Where Boys Fear to
            Tread&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later Two computer games were created based on the joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Smashing Pumpkins into Small Piles of Putrid Debris</i> is a 2D
            action game from Jamul Software (later Hamumu Software) in which the
            player collects candles and smashes pumpkins with a red hammer. It
            was reportedly developed in 48 hours to capitalize on the joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hamumu Software later created a similar game called
            <i>Amazin&apos; SPISPOPD</i>, and several other games based off of
            its rendition of SPISPOPD that did not share any similarities to the
            original fictional title.

          <h3>Replayability</h3>
          <p>
            The original Doom and Doom 2 had and has a map builder that allows
            players to create custom and unique content. <br />A lot of amazing
            levels or &quot;wads&quot; have been created and continue to be
            created to this day. (ever since 1993!) Some teams of mappers or
            even extraordinarily talented solo mappers have created what are
            known as &quot;mega wads&quot;. These mega wads consist of 32 levels
            and are essentially an entirely new game in the doom engine. Many
            different mega wads exist and can still be played today with the
            original Doom in a DOS emulator like DOSbox or more conveniently on
            modern source ports of the Doom engine code such as Boom, Chocolate
            Doom, Crispy Doom, GZDoom, and many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            These modern source ports have many different features. For example,
            keeping true to the original Doom bugs and all but making it run on
            modern systems without the use of DOSbox; while some other source
            ports fix those bugs. However many people choose to play with the
            bugs in place for a more authentic and &quot;true&quot; experience.
            Further still, another source port, GZDoom makes use of modern
            graphics libraries to bring 3D to Doom and Doom 2's textures and
            even allows the player to look up and down without any distortion or
            stretched textures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other talented members of the community have also performed magic,
            or &quot;skillful programming&quot;, to bring not just 3D visuals to
            Doom but also fully 3D character models and have created their own
            3D games within Doom.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is because of these amazing community maps, sourceports, mods,
            and new creations that Doom and Doom 2 are still played and continue
            to have a thriving community almost 3 <i>Decades</i> after Doom's
            initial release.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doom Eternal has none of this.<br />You'll instead have a fantastic
            single player playthrough and when you're done, well that's it.
            You're done. Uninstall the game and get your storage space back.
