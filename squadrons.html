            Who will you fight for? The Empire? The Rebel Alliance? Make your
            choice; and when you choose, just remember one thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Death Star was a massive orbital battle station the size of a
            moon. Constructued by the Galactic Empire, this battle station cost
            over 1 trillion Galactic credits and carried a crew of 1,206,293
            personnel, 342,953 Imperial Navy and Army garrisons, 25,984
            Stormtroopers, and an additional 750,000 passengers. Totaling
            2,325,230 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Death Star II was in the midst of construction by the Galactic
            Empire after the destruction of the first Death Star. This new
            battle station was significantly larger that its predecessor. It
            carried a crew of 485,560 personnel, 152,275 troopers, 127,570
            infantry, 75,860 technical personnel, and 334,432 pilots.
            <br />Totaling 2,471,647 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the <b>Battle of Yavin</b> in the year 0 BBY (Before Battle
            of Yavin) Rebel forces launched an attack on the Death Star orbital
            battle station. This attack resulted in the destruction of the Death
            Star and the deaths of all 2,325,230 people on board the orbital
            battle station.<br />During the <b>Battle of Endor</b> in the year 4
            ABY (After the Battle of Yavin) Rebel forces launched another
            attack. This time against the Death Star II. This attack resulted in
            the destruction of the Death Star II, the start of the
            <b>Imperial Civil War</b>, and the deaths of all 2,471,647 people on
            board the battle station.
          </p>
          <p>
            4,796,877<br />
            The collective death toll of both the <b>Battle of Yavin</b> and the
            <b>Battle of Endor</b>.<br />These victims were simply trying to
            earn credits to feed and support their families on distant planets.
            They were looking forward to seeing them again in the future after
            being so far away for so long. These victims had children, spouses,
            parents, and grandchildren waiting their return from duty. While the
            Rebels cheered and celebrated the destructions of the Death Star and
            Death Star II; across the galaxy the families of 4,796,877 people
            were mourning the loss of their loved ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            So remember that number. <br />4,796,877<br />
            And remember how all those families felt when you choose the Rebel
            Alliance; you monster.

          <p>
            In December 18, 2000, Factor 5 released a game titled
            <b>Star Wars Episode I: Battle for Naboo</b>. Prior to this game
            they had also developed and released &quot;Rogue Squadron&quot; but
            Battle for Naboo perfected the formula they had created for Rogue
            Squadron. Battle for Naboo had exciting gameplay, impressive
            graphics and what many described as &quot;tight and responsive&quot;
            controls.<br />Squadrons feels just like going back and playing a
            Factor 5 game all over again. Great graphics, great gameplay, and
            great controls.

          <p>
            Squadrons is the perfect game to use a HOTAS or &quot;Hands On
            Throttle And Stick&quot; by <b>Thrustmaster</b>. It's also the
            perfect oportunity to use the word HOTAS since HOTAS doesn't come up
            much in usual conversation. HOTAS is a great word and it just rolls
            off the tongue. So any chance you get to say HOTAS; you should take
            it.<br /><b>HOTAS</b>
